### Simple Exponential Smoothing 

Let's say you have time series data and you would like to forecast its next data points. 
If your data shows no trend and no seasonality you are good to go by using the simple explonetial smoothing model.
The logic behind this model is that the most recent observations are better predictors of future data points, hence 
more weight is given to them. 
So a forecast is calculated using the equation below:
